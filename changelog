highlighting-kate 0.3.1 (27 Nov 2011)

  * Fixed a release bug in 0.3.  The Clojure module was not included
    in the cabal file.

highlighting-kate 0.3 (26 Nov 2011)

  * Use -O0 by default to speed compiling.  This vastly improves compilation
    speed and reduces memory requirements.  In some rough tests, it does not
    seem to hurt performance much, but those who need maximum performance
    should compile with -O2 (or use a different library, like illuminate).

  * Updated syntax descriptions from kate repository.

  * Removed some syntaxes to trim the bloated package.
    Removed: ansys, cisco, cue, desktop, fstab, gap, gdb,
    gettext, idl, m3u, pango, winehq, wml.

  * Added syntax definition for Clojure (thanks to Caspar Hasenclever).

highlighting-kate 0.2.10 (16 Jul 2011)

  * Fixed class on line numbers td.  (Thanks to tantignac)
  * Allow empty context stack.
    `currentContext` returns "" if stack is empty, and this is
    treated as the first context in the list by `parseRules`.
    This fixes a problem with syntax definitions like erlang.xml,
    which has `#pop` as `lineEndContext` in the first context,
    leading to an infinite loop with the old code.
  * Syntax highlighting for CoffeeScript (thanks to igstan).
  * Fixed links in README (thanks to John Gabriele).

highlighting-kate 0.2.9 (29 Jan 2011)

  * Added OptInline to FormatOptions.  Inline code is formatted
    with a "code" tag but no "pre" tag.
  * Put language class on "code" instead of "pre".
    Put "sourceCode" class on "pre" in addition to "code".
  * Fixed a bug in tango style with numbering.

highlighting-kate 0.2.8.2 (28 Jan 2011)

  * formatAsXHtml: Don't put `<br/>` after last line.
  * Added F# highlighting based on the present ocaml definitions
    (Bas Bossink).

highlighting-kate 0.2.8.1 (02 Jan 2011)

  * Updated parseSyntaxFiles.hs to use HXT 9.0.0.

  * Added Makefile to help developers.
    When you check out the source from the repository, you can now
    do 'make prep' to generate the syntax parsers from the xml
    definitions.

  * Improved installation instructions.

  * Updated grammar files from Kate (Tianyi Cui).

  * Fixed bug in endline parsing (pointed out by Samuel Hym).
    + The bug occurs when you're nested two contexts in, and you hit
      the end of a line. Even if both contexts were set up to
      popContext at the end of line, previously only the first
      context was popped.  Example: in bash,
      export A=a
      export B=b
      The second 'export' was being highlighted as VarName.
    + Common: Added pHandleEndline.
    + ParseSyntaxFiles:  don't consume newline if you pop context at end
      of line; instead, fall back to next context and try the newline
      again.

  * Changed type of pPopContext. Now returns () instead of String.

  * Use doxygen instead of doxygenlua in lua parser.
    Using doxygenlua causes many lines to be erroneously
    interpreted as comments.  Reverting to doxygen as before
    fixes things.  Not sure if this is a bug in the lua.xml
    file or in highlighting-kate.

  * Added css based on Pygment’s tango style theme (Samuel Hym).

highlighting-kate 0.2.7.1 (15 July 2010)

  * Don't use the withAttribute combinator with null attribute.

  * Fixed literate-haskell.xml to include attributes.

highlighting-kate 0.2.7 (15 July 2010)

  * New, compressed format for classes. Two-letter class names are now
    used for default styles, and detailed lexical information is omitted
    unless the new OptDetailed option is specified. Also, the "Normal"
    style is no longer used, and spans are not used for "normal" markup.
    The result is significant compression of the highlighted source (in
    one test, 191K -> 72K).

  * Updated the css files in css/ to use the new two-letter class names.
    Users should update their css files, or highlighting will no longer
    work.

  * New OptDetailed option (see above).

  * Added languagesByFilename function.  Unlike the old
    languagesByExtension, this properly handles things like
    "Makefile" and "CMake.txt."

  * A new -d/--detailed option has been provided in the Highlight
    executable. This selects OptDetailed.

  * Improvements to haskell.xml and literate-haskell.xml,
    due to Nicolas Wu.

  * Added octave syntax definition.

  * Changed ParseSyntaxFiles to work with GHC 6.12.

  * ParseSyntaxFiles now uses Text/Highlighting/Kate/Syntax.hs.in
    as a template for construction of Text.Highlighting.Kate.Syntax
    module.

  * Removed parsec < 3 restriction.

  * Minor code cleanup and improvement.

highlighting-kate 0.2.6.2 (06 March 2010)

  * Use separate definitions for compiled regexes.
    This speeds up compilation significantly.

  * Replaced list_(hash) with list_(list_name) for readability.

highlighting-kate 0.2.6.1 (06 March 2010)

  * Performance improvements suggested by Joachim Breitner.
    These reduce compile time and executable size significantly
    (by almost half), and yield a slight speedup in run time.
    + Use Set instead of list for keywords.
    + Put keyword sets in separate definitions.
    + Use words and unwords to trick GHC into not inlining the
      lists of keywords, which slows compilation considerably.

  * Changed ghc-prof-options to include -caf-all and -O0.

highlighting-kate 0.2.6 (22 Jan 2010)

  * Added OptLineAnchors FormatOption.  When used with
    OptNumberLines, this includes a link anchor on each line,
    so users can link to a particular line in a highlighted source
    file.  Thanks to Daniel Patterson for the idea.

  * Default to using regex-pcre-builtin, unless pcre-light flag is
    turned on.  regex-pcre-builtin contains c sources for pcre, so it
    should now be possible to install highlighting-kate without manually
    installing the pcre library first -- a hurdle for some users.

highlighting-kate 0.2.5.1 (29 Nov 2009)

  * Modified ParseSyntaxFiles to use UTF8, since otherwise hscolour
    compiled with GHC 6.12 will choke on the latin1 characters
    in some of the comments giving the authors of the original
    kate syntax files.  Thanks to Sergei Trofimovich for pointing
    out the problem.

  * Fixed regexp in single line comment detector so infix ops like -->
    are not treated as comments.  (Thanks to Dmitri Golubovsky for
	the patch, also contributed to kate upstream.)

  * Use Cabal to get version instead of hardcoding it.

highlighting-kate 0.2.5 (04 Jul 2009)

  * Changed highlightAs to go by file extension if unambiguous.

  * New Relaxngcompact syntax definition.

  * Removed unused mkIdentifier in ParseSyntaxFiles.

  * Moved 'capitalize' to ParseSyntaxFiles and fixed its defn.

  * Removed list of supported languages from description.
    Spell 50 as "fifty" in description.

highlighting-kate 0.2.4 (15 Mar 2009)

  * Fixed bug in literate-haskell-xml. Also fixed now upstream.
    (Bjorn Buckwalter)

  * Modified ParseSyntaxFiles.hs to allow regeneration of individual
    syntax files. With the change ParseSyntaxFiles accepts any number of
    arguments. Those ending with .xml are assumed to be files while the
    rest are assumed to be directories containing .xml files.
    The syntaxes included in Syntax.hs are based on the contents of
    destDir rather than the arguments, this allows regenerating a subset
    of syntaxes but still having all syntaxes in Syntax.hs. (Bjorn Buckwalter)

  * ParseSyntaxFiles.hs: Change deprecated pragma, remove obsolete import.
    (Bjorn Buckwalter)

highlighting-kate 0.2.3 (9 Jul 2008)

  * Removed -O2 in Ghc-Options, as it provides very little speedup

highlighting-kate 0.2.2 (9 Jul 2008)

  * Added Cc-options -O0 to cabal file. This is needed to prevent
    gcc from using enormous amounts of memory on platforms
    that lack a native code generator and compile via C. See
    http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=469893.

  * Depend on parsec < 3, because parsec 3 is much slower.

  * normalizeHighlighting now strips out empty strings

highlighting-kate 0.2.1 (10 Feb 2008)

  *  Implemented lookAhead in parsers, which fixed bugs in perl, bash,
     and other parsers.

highlighting-kate 0.2 (10 Feb 2008)

  *  Initial release
